# express-mail-demo
This code will help you to have a basic understanding about how you can dynamically generate mails through your express server.

As a web developer one always wants that the server they are creating must contain mail generating feature for the necessary stuff like giving users a welcome message, validating
the mail address entered by the user, giving notifications and password reset links etc.

This very basic mail assistant will help you understand how nodemailer works and how you can use it to send mails through your express server.

In short I've given you the key, now open the treasure chest and create mail generating servers!!

The CSS template that I used is from -> colorlib.com
